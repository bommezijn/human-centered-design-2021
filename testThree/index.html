    <h1>Test: Humane interaction</h1>
    <p>The idea of this test is find out what feels more humane to you.</p>
    <p class="question">The transcript about <i>the power of the black hole</i> is spoken by multiple people, which
      speaker looks more pleasant to read?</p>
    <p class="question">Instead of always searching for transcript yourself, What is your opininion about subscribing
      and receiving a notification it is available? <br> <span class="alt-text">A possibility of a chrome extension that
        keeps record of the podcasts you want to read?</span></p>

        <p>Imagine a distant future when humans reach beyond our pale blue dot, forge cities on planets thousands of
          light-years away, and maintain a galactic web of trade and transport. What would it take for our civilization
          to make that leap? There are many things to consider— <br> <i>how would we communicate?</i> <br><i>What might
            a galactic
            government look like?</i><br> And one of the most fundamental of all: where would we get enough energy to
          power that
          civilization— its industry, its terraforming operations, and its starships? </p>

          <p>An astronomer named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Kardashev">Nikolai Kardashev</a>
            proposed a scale <a href="#" class="tooltip"
              data-tooltip="Navigate to text in video is not implemented"><span class="current">to quantify an evolving
                civilization’s increasing
                energy needs.</span></a><br>
            <br>In the first evolutionary stage, which we’re currently in, planet-based fuel sources like
            fossil
            fuels, solar panels and nuclear power plants are probably enough to settle other planets inside our own
            solar
            system, but not much beyond that. For a civilization on the third and final stage, expansion on a galactic
            scale would require about 100 billion times more energy than the full 385 yotta joules our sun releases
            every
            second. Barring a breakthrough in exotic physics, there’s only one energy source that could suffice: a
            supermassive black hole. </p>

        <p>It’s counterintuitive to think of black holes as energy sources, but that’s exactly what they are, thanks to
          their accretion disks: circular, flat structures formed by matter falling into the event horizon. </p>
        <span class="speaker speaker3">Chandler Bing</span>
        <span><span class="timestamp">02:42</span></span>
        <p>Because of conservation of angular momentum, particles there don’t just plummet straight into the black hole.
          Instead, they slowly spiral.</p>
        <span class="speaker speaker3">Chandler Bing</span>
        <span><span class="timestamp">02:42</span></span>
        <p>Due to the intense gravitational field of the black hole, these particles convert
          their potential energy to kinetic energy as they inch closer to the event horizon.</p>
        <span class="speaker speaker3">Chandler Bing</span>
        <span><span class="timestamp">02:42</span></span>
        <p> Particle interactions allow
          for this kinetic energy to be radiated out into space at an astonishing matter-to-energy efficiency: 6% for
          non-rotating black holes, and up to 32% for rotating ones.</p>
        <span class="speaker speaker3">Chandler Bing</span>
        <span><span class="timestamp">02:42</span></span>
        <p> This drastically outshines nuclear fission,
          currently the most efficient widely available mechanism to extract energy from mass. Fission converts just
          0.08% of a Uranium atom into energy. </p>
