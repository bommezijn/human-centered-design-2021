        <p>Imagine a distant future when humans reach beyond our pale blue dot, forge cities on planets thousands of
          light-years away, and maintain a galactic web of trade and transport. What would it take for our civilization
          to make that leap? There are many things to consider— <br> <i>how would we communicate?</i> <br><i>What might a galactic
            government look like?</i><br> And one of the most fundamental of all: where would we get enough energy to power that
          civilization— its industry, its terraforming operations, and its starships? </p>

          <p>An astronomer named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Kardashev">Nikolai Kardashev</a>
            proposed a scale <a href="#" class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Navigate to text in video is not implemented"><span class="current">to quantify an evolving civilization’s increasing
              energy needs.</span></a>
            <br>In the first evolutionary stage, which we’re currently in, planet-based fuel sources like
            fossil
            fuels, solar panels and nuclear power plants are probably enough to settle other planets inside our own
            solar
            system, but not much beyond that. For a civilization on the third and final stage, expansion on a galactic
            scale would require about 100 billion times more energy than the full 385 yotta joules our sun releases
            every
            second. Barring a breakthrough in exotic physics, there’s only one energy source that could suffice: a
            supermassive black hole. </p>

        <p>It’s counterintuitive to think of black holes as energy sources, but that’s exactly what they are, thanks to
          their accretion disks: circular, flat structures formed by matter falling into the event horizon. </p>
